# Exercise-3

As described in the [git-basics
chapter](https://info201.github.io/git-basics.html), you should begin
by forking this repository, then cloning it to your local machine (if
you haven't already).

In the space below, you'll provide some information about a terminal
command you've learned thus far in the class (or elsewhere ;-).  In particular, you
should include the following:

A `heading` with the name of the command

An example of how it can be used (with appropriate code highlighting)

A _nested list_ of information about the command (i.e., things that it does, or how it can be used)

# rm

The `rm` command can be used to delete a file or folder. For example:

`rm bad_README.md`

Here is more information about the `rm` command:
- It can be used recursively to remove directories and their contents with the `-R` option: `rm -R info201`
	- This behavior can also be called using the `-r` or `--recursive` option
- You can remove empty directories using `--d` or `--dir` option: `rm -d empty_directory/`






See `complete` branch for answers.
